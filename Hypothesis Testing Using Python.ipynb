    "Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to make inferences or draw conclusions about a population based on a sample of data. By formulating and testing hypotheses, researchers can determine whether there is sufficient evidence to support or refute a given claim or assumption. In hypothesis testing, we typically start with a *null hypothesis* (H0), which represents a default or no-effect assumption, and an *alternative hypothesis* (H1 or Ha), which reflects the effect or difference we aim to detect.n."

    "\n",
    "- **Conversion Rate**: This rate, similar in range to the CTR, spans from 0.01 to 0.50, with a mean of about 0.25. This implies that approximately 25% of visitors complete a desired action, like signing up or making a purchase.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bounce Rate**: The bounce rate, which represents the percentage of visitors who leave without interacting further, varies from 0.20 to 0.80, with an average rate of 0.51. This suggests that, on average, 51% of visitors do not engage with additional content.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scroll Depth**: This metric indicates how far down a page users scroll, ranging from 20.01% to nearly 80%, with an average depth of 50.32%. This shows a moderate level of engagement, with users scrolling about halfway through a page on average.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Age**: User age ranges between 18 and 65, with an average age of about 41.5 years, suggesting a diverse age range for website users.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Session Duration**: Session duration spans significantly, from as short as 38 seconds to around 1,800 seconds (or 30 minutes), with an average session lasting approximately 925 seconds (around 15 minutes). This indicates variable engagement levels, with an average session suggesting moderate interaction. \n",
